	<p>I'm not much of an artist, I however did take a drawing class last semester where these pictures are the result of.
I'm focusing on aniation more through my courses here and hopefully will find that style I enjoy most from that.
My favorite piece from that class is the dog, it was a chimera assignment which I may go forward in animation with the dog picture.</p>
