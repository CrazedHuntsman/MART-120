What affected me most out of the lecture was the point he made about waiting long enough with people to let them surprise you and show you their good side.
That people have a lot more to them and with time that with come out and shine. 
The other thing that affected me was the other point of dont be doing things for yourself, do them for other.
That is kinda the reason I am currently here is for other that give me the drive for this.
